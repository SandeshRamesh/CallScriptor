    "Hi Robert, I'm Sandesh from Cluely - appreciate you hopping on.",
    "My job today it to show you how our AI software helps sales teams sell smarter on Zoom - especially newer reps - by giving them the script, live, while they're on the call.",
    "Ready to Go?",
    "Let me ask - how are you currently making sure reps stick to the script during calls?",
    "Do you feel like your newer reps are confident handling objections in real time?",
    "How are you currently tracking whether your team is following the script or going off-track?",
    "Here's what we've built: imagine your reps are on Zoom, and the script appears live - line by line - as they're speaking.",
    "If the prospect throws an objection like 'I need to think about it,' the AI instantly detects it and pulls the right script response on-screen - so the rep knows exactly what to say.",
    "Managers love it because it standardizes calls and gives visibility into which reps are sticking to the process.",
    "It works right out of the box with Zoom - no dev work required.",
    "Let me show you the live interface - here's what the rep sees on Zoom: script at the top, objection handler slides in when needed.",
    "Do you have any questions for me before we move forward? (Keep asking)",
    "Mind if I walk you through the pricing and onboarding process?",
    "Most teams that see the demo move forward - especially when they're scaling or onboarding new reps.",
    "We get you set up in under 24 hours, with your script and objection library already loaded. Our pricing is either $3,000 for the full startup package or $1,000 for a do it yourself script with tutorials we provide.",
    "When you're ready, I'll send you a quick digital agreement and get our onboarding team scheduled.",
    "You'll get a recap email with everything we covered, plus the agreement link.",
    "Once you're signed up, we'll customize your scripts, set up your team, and do a live walkthrough with your managers.",
    "Looking forward to helping your team win more calls!"
